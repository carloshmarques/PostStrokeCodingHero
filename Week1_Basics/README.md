## ðŸ“˜ Week 1 â€“ Basics

---
This folder contains the first exercises of my recovery journey. The goal is to reactivate memory and focus using simple C# programs:

- `HelloWorld.cs`: A welcome message to restart coding-
- `VariablesAndComments.cs`: Practice with basic data and English comments.
- `SimpleMath.cs`: A small math operation to train logic

## ðŸš€ Usage

These `.cs` files were created using Git Bash and edited with the Nano editor.  
Make sure your environment is set up to compile and run C# files manually if you're not using Visual Studio.
