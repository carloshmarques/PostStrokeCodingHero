## 📘 Week 1 – Basics

This folder contains the first exercises of my recovery journey. The goal is to reactivate memory and focus using simple C# programs:

- `HelloWorld.cs`: A welcome message to restart coding
- `VariablesAndComments.cs`: Practice with basic data and English comments
- `SimpleMath.cs`: A small math operation to train logic
